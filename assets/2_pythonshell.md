# The Python Shell

In this module you can learn:
+ How to use Python as a pocket calculator
+ How to store data in variables
+ How to import functions from Python modules



### Traces in the desert sand…

Python can be used as a calculator:

```
>>> 1+2
>>> 3
```

Fill in dashed lines with appropriate values using the python interactive shell

```
>>> 1 _ _ 2
>>> 3
>>> 12 - _ _
4
>>> _ _ * 5
20
>>> _ _ ** 2
81
```


Python can be used to store variables:

```
>>> camels = 9
>>> camels
_ _
>>> silk = camels *  _ _
>> silk
36
>>> math.sqrt(silk)
_ _
>>> math.pow(camels, _ _ )
81.0
```


### The interactive Python shell
You can access the shell by typing `python` in a command-line terminal

```
$ python
Python 2.7.9 (default, Apr  2 2015, 15:33:21)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

You can leave the shell with  `Ctrl-D`

Challenge #1

> Open a Python interactive session (the Python shell):
>
>+  Calculate the sum and difference of two
numbers
>+  Divide two numbers. Try 5/3.
>+ Then try 5.0/3
>+  Calculate 3x5
>+  Calculate a power of 2
>

### Variables
Variables are containers for data.

Variable names may be composed of letters, underscores and, after the first position, also digits.

```
>>> camels = 9
>>> camels
9
>>> silk = camels * 4
>> silk
36
```

### The math module

 Sometimes you need more complex mathematical constants and functions

+  square root
+  factorial
+  sine or cosine
+  pi
+  log

Python groups them together in a text file. You can access them by importing the file.
```
import math
```

Find the matching pairs of functions and x/y values.

### The Dogma of Programming

+ First, make it work.
+ Second, make it nice.
+ Third, and only if it is really necessary, make it fast.

>The hydrolysis of one phosphodiester bond from ATP results in a standard Gibbs energy (ΔG<sup>0</sup>) of -30.5 kJ/mol. According to biochemistry textbooks, the real ΔG value depends on the concentration of the compounds and these concentrations can differ quite a lot among tissues.
>
>The Gibbs energy as a function of the concentrations of the compounds can be written as:
>
>ΔG = ΔG<sup>0</sup>  + RT \* ln ( [ADP] * [Pi] / [ATP])
>
>Knowing that:
>
>R = 0.00831
>
>T = 298
>
>+  Use Python to calculate the real DG in the tissues reported in the table.
>+  Use variables for the parameters.
>+  Print the results to the screen.
